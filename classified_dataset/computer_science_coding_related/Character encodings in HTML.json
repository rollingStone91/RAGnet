  "title": "Character encodings in HTML",
  "content": "While Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) has been in use since 1991, HTML 4.0 from December 1997 was the first standardized version where international characters were given reasonably complete treatment. When an HTML document includes special characters outside the range of seven-bit ASCII, two goals are worth considering: the information's integrity, and universal browser display.\n\nSpecifying the document's character encoding\nThere are two general ways to specify which character encoding is used in the document.\n\nFirst, the web server can include the character encoding or \"charset\" in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Content-Type header, which would typically look like this:\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nThis method gives the HTTP server a convenient way to alter document's encoding according to content negotiation; certain HTTP server software can do it, for example Apache with the module mod_charset_lite.\n\nSecond, a declaration can be included within the document itself.\n\nFor HTML it is possible to include this information inside the head element near the top of the document:\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n\nHTML5 also allows the following syntax to mean exactly the same:\n\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n\nXHTML documents have a third option: to express the character encoding via XML declaration, as follows:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\nWith this second approach, because the character encoding cannot be known until the declaration is parsed, there is a problem knowing which character encoding is used in the document up to and including the declaration itself. If the character encoding is an ASCII extension then the content up to and including the declaration itself should be pure ASCII and this will work correctly. For character encodings that are not ASCII extensions (i.e. not a superset of ASCII), such as UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE, a processor of HTML, such as a web browser, should be able to parse the declaration in some cases through the use of heuristics.\n\nEncoding detection algorithm \nAs of HTML5 the recommended charset is UTF-8. An \"encoding sniffing algorithm\" is defined in the specification to determine the character encoding of the document based on multiple sources of input, including:\n Explicit user instruction\n An explicit meta tag within the first 1024 bytes of the document\n A byte order mark (BOM) within the first three bytes of the document\n The HTTP Content-Type or other transport layer information\n Analysis of the document bytes looking for specific sequences or ranges of byte values, and other tentative detection mechanisms.\n\nCharacters outside of the printable ASCII range (32 to 126) usually appear incorrectly. This presents few problems for English-speaking users, but other languages regularly—in some cases, always—require characters outside that range. In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) language environments where there are several different multi-byte encodings in use, auto-detection is also often employed. Finally, browsers usually permit the user to override incorrect charset label manually as well.\n\nIt is increasingly common for multilingual websites and websites in non-Western languages to use UTF-8, which allows use of the same encoding for all languages. UTF-16 or UTF-32, which can be used for all languages as well, are less widely used because they can be harder to handle in programming languages that assume a byte-oriented ASCII superset encoding, and they are less efficient for text with a high frequency of ASCII characters, which is usually the case for HTML documents.\n\nSuccessful viewing of a page is not necessarily an indication that its encoding is specified correctly. If the page's creator and reader are both assuming some platform-specific character encoding, and the server does not send any identifying information, then the reader will nonetheless see the page as the creator intended, but other readers on different platforms or with different native languages will not see the page as intended.\n\nPermitted encodings\nThe WHATWG Encoding Standard, referenced by recent HTML standards (the current WHATWG HTML Living Standard, as well as the formerly competing W3C HTML 5.0 and 5.1) specifies a list of encodings which browsers must support. The HTML standards forbid support of other encodings. The Encoding Standard further stipulates that new formats, new protocols (even when existing formats are used) and authors of new documents are required to use UTF-8 exclusively.\n\nBesides UTF-8, the following encodings are explicitly listed in the HTML standard itself, with reference to the Encoding Standard:\n\nThe following additional encodings are listed in the Encoding Standard, and support for them is therefore also required:\n\nThe following encodings are listed as explicit examples of forbidden encodings:\n\nThe standard also defines a \"replacement\" decoder, which maps all content labelled as certain encodings to the replacement character (�), refusing to process it at all. This is intended to prevent attacks (e.g. cross site scripting) which may exploit a difference between the client and server in what encodings are supported in order to mask malicious content. Although the same security concern applies to ISO-2022-JP and UTF-16, which also allow sequences of ASCII bytes to be interpreted differently, this approach was not seen as feasible for them since they are comparatively more frequently used in deployed content. The following encodings receive this treatment:\n\nCharacter references\n\nIn addition to native character encodings, characters can also be encoded as character references, which can be numeric character references (decimal or hexadecimal) or character entity references. Character entity references are also sometimes referred to as named entities, or HTML entities for HTML. HTML's usage of character references derives from SGML.\n\nHTML character references\n\nA numeric character reference in HTML refers to a character by its Universal Character Set/Unicode code point, and uses the format\n\n&#nnnn;\nor\n&#xhhhh;\n\nwhere nnnn is the code point in decimal form, and hhhh is the code point in hexadecimal form. The x must be lowercase in XML documents. The nnnn or hhhh may be any number of digits and may include leading zeros. The hhhh may mix uppercase and lowercase, though uppercase is the usual style.\n\nNot all web browsers or email clients used by receivers of HTML documents, or text editors used by authors of HTML documents, will be able to render all HTML characters. Most modern software is able to display most or all of the characters for the user's language, and will draw a box or other clear indicator for characters they cannot render.\n\nFor codes from 0 to 127, the original 7-bit ASCII standard set, most of these characters can be used without a character reference. Codes from 160 to 255 can all be created using character entity names. Only a few higher-numbered codes can be created using entity names, but all can be created by decimal number character reference.\n\nCharacter entity references can also have the format &name; where name is a case-sensitive alphanumeric string. For example, \"λ\" can also be encoded as &lambda; in an HTML document. The character entity references &lt;, &gt;, &quot; and &amp; are predefined in HTML and SGML, because <, >, \"  and & are already used to delimit markup. This notably did not include XML's &apos; (') entity prior to HTML5. For a list of all named HTML character entity references along with the versions in which they were introduced, see List of XML and HTML character entity references.\n\nUnnecessary use of HTML character references may significantly reduce HTML readability. If the character encoding for a web page is chosen appropriately, then HTML character references are usually only required for markup delimiting characters as mentioned above, and for a few special characters (or none at all if a native Unicode encoding like UTF-8 is used). Incorrect HTML entity escaping may also open up security vulnerabilities for injection attacks such as cross-site scripting. If HTML attributes are left unquoted, certain characters, most importantly whitespace, such as space and tab, must be escaped using entities. Other languages related to HTML have their own methods of escaping characters.\n\nXML character references\nUnlike traditional HTML with its large range of character entity references, in XML there are only five predefined character entity references. These are used to escape characters that are markup sensitive in certain contexts:\n\nAll other character entity references have to be defined before they can be used. For example, use of &eacute; (which gives é, Latin lower-case E with acute accent, U+00E9 in Unicode) in an XML document will generate an error unless the entity has already been defined. XML also requires that the x in hexadecimal numeric references be in lowercase: for example &#xA1b rather than &#XA1b. XHTML, which is an XML application, supports the HTML entity set, along with XML's predefined entities.\n\nSee also \n Charset sniffing – used by many browsers when character encoding metadata is not available\n Unicode and HTML\n Language code\n List of XML and HTML character entity references\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Online HTML entity encoder & decoder tool\n Character entity references in HTML4\n The Definitive Guide to Web Character Encoding\n HTML Entity Encoding chapter of Browser Security Handbook – more information about current browsers and their entity handling\n The Open Web Application Security Project's wiki article on cross-site scripting (XSS)\n\nHTML\nWorld Wide Web Consortium standards"
