  "content": "Aberavon (Welsh: Aberafan) is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom since 2015 by Stephen Kinnock of the Welsh Labour Party. It includes the town of Aberavon, although the largest town in the constituency is Port Talbot.\n\nThe constituency is set to be abolished, as part of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies and under the June 2023 final recommendations of the Boundary Commission for Wales for the next United Kingdom general election. Its wards is to be split between Aberafan Maesteg and Neath and Swansea East.\n\nHistory\nThe constituency was created for the 1918 general election by the dividing of the Swansea District. With the exception of the first term, it has always been held by the Labour Party. Ramsay MacDonald, who became Labour's first Prime Minister in 1924, held the seat from 1922 to 1929. Its current MP, Stephen Kinnock, is the son of Neil Kinnock, who was Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition from 1983 to 1992.\n\nIt is one of the most consistently safe seats for Labour; since the end of the Second World War, the Labour candidate has always won Aberavon with a majority at least 33%, and with the exception of 2015, the Labour candidate has also always won an overall majority of the vote in the seat. In 2015, Kinnock only won 48.9% of the vote in Aberavon, against a surge in the vote for the UKIP candidate; however, in 2017, Kinnock's vote share rose by 19.2 percentage points, the biggest increase in the Labour vote in the seat's history, and his majority increased to 50.4%, the highest for an Aberavon MP since 2001. The 2017 result also made Aberavon the safest Labour seat in Wales, however the seat saw a significant swing against Labour in 2019.\n\nBoundaries\n\n1918–1950: The Borough of Aberavon, the Urban Districts of Briton Ferry, Glencorwg, Margam, and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural Districts of Neath and Penybont.\n\n1950–1983: The Borough of Port Talbot, the Urban Districts of Glyncorrwg and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural District of Penybont.\n\n1983–1997: The Borough of Afan, and the Borough of Neath wards nos. 3 and 6.\n\n1997–2010: The Borough of Port Talbot, and the Borough of Neath wards of Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North and Coedffranc West.\n\n2010–present: The Neath Port Talbot County Borough electoral divisions of Aberavon, Baglan, Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Bryn and Cwmavon, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North, Coedffranc West, Cymmer, Glyncorrwg, Gwynfi, Margam, Port Talbot, Sandfields East, Sandfields West, and Tai-bach.\n\nThe constituency is in South Wales, situated on the right bank of the River Afan, near its mouth in Swansea Bay.\n\nCommenting on the 1983 boundary changes to the constituency when moving the 2000 Loyal Address of the Blair Government in Parliament, the seat's then-MP Sir John Morris, who would retire at the next general election, said:\n\nMembers of Parliament\n\nElections\n\nElections in the 1910s\n\nJones withdrew in favour of Edwards on 13 December 1918.\n\nElections in the 1920s\n\nElections in the 1930s\n\nElections in the 1940s\n\nElections in the 1950s\n\nElections in the 1960s\n\nElections in the 1970s\n\nElections in the 1980s\n\nElections in the 1990s\n\nElections in the 2000s\n\nElections in the 2010s\n\nOf the 44 rejected ballots:\n29 were either unmarked or it was uncertain who the vote was for.\n14 voted for more than one candidate.\n1 had writing or mark by which the voter could be identified.\n\nOf the 57 rejected ballots:\n37 were either unmarked or it was uncertain who the vote was for.\n20 voted for more than one candidate.\n\nOf the 57 rejected ballots:\n41 were either unmarked or it was uncertain who the vote was for.\n16 voted for more than one candidate.\n\nOf the 82 rejected ballots:\n61 were either unmarked or it was uncertain who the vote was for.\n19 voted for more than one candidate.\n2 had writing or mark by which the voter could be identified.\n\nSee also\n Aberavon (Senedd constituency)\n List of parliamentary constituencies in West Glamorgan\n List of parliamentary constituencies in Wales\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPolitics Resources (election results from 1922 onwards)\nElectoral Calculus (election results from 1955 onwards)\n2017 Election House Of Commons Library 2017 Election report\nA Vision Of Britain Through Time (constituency elector numbers)\n\nFurther reading\n\nParliamentary constituencies in South Wales\nPolitics of Neath Port Talbot\nConstituencies of the Parliament of the United Kingdom established in 1918\nRamsay MacDonald"
