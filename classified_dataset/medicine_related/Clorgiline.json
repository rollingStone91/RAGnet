  "title": "Clorgiline",
  "content": "Clorgiline (INN), or clorgyline (BAN), is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) structurally related to pargyline which is described as an antidepressant. Specifically, it is an irreversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). Clorgiline was never marketed, but it has found use in scientific research. It has been found to bind with high affinity to the σ1 receptor (Ki = 3.2 nM) and with very high affinity to the I2 imidazoline receptor (Ki = 40 pM).\n\nClorgiline is also a multidrug efflux pump inhibitor. Holmes et al., 2012 reverse azole fungicide resistance using clorgiline, showing promise for its use in multiple fungicide resistance.\n\nReferences \n\nAbandoned drugs\nPropargyl compounds\nAmines\nChloroarenes\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors\nPhenol ethers\nSigma agonists"
