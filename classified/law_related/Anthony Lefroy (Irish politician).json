He returned to the seat in 1842–1847, when he was declared elected after a petition challenging the result of the 1841 general election. He was appointed High Sheriff of Longford for 1849–50. He then represented his father's old seat, the University constituency of Dublin University, from 1858 to 1870.  In 1870 he accepted the Chiltern Hundreds and left Parliament.\n\nHe died at Carrickglass in 1890. He had married the Hon. Jane King, daughter of Robert King, 1st Viscount Lorton. They had one son, who predeceased him, and two daughters. His estates passed to his brother, Thomas, who himself died the next year.\n\nReferences\n Who's Who of British Members of Parliament: Vol. I 1832-1885, edited by Michael Stenton (The Harvester Press 1976)\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1800 births\n1890 deaths\nAlumni of Trinity College Dublin\nMembers of Lincoln's Inn\nIrish Conservative Party MPs\nMembers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Longford constituencies (1801–1922)\nMembers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Dublin University\nPoliticians from County Dublin\nUK MPs 1830–1831\nUK MPs 1831–1832\nUK MPs 1832–1835\nUK MPs 1835–1837\nUK MPs 1841–1847\nUK MPs 1857–1859\nUK MPs 1859–1865\nUK MPs 1865–1868\nUK MPs 1868–1874\nHigh Sheriffs of Longford\nAlumni of King's Inns"
