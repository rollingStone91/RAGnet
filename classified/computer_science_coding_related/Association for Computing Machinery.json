  "content": "The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a US-based international learned society for computing. It was founded in 1947 and is the world's largest scientific and educational computing society. The ACM is a non-profit professional membership group, reporting nearly 110,000 student and professional members . Its headquarters are in New York City.\n\nThe ACM is an umbrella organization for academic and scholarly interests in computer science (informatics). Its motto is \"Advancing Computing as a Science & Profession\".\n\nHistory\nIn 1947, a notice was sent to various people:\nOn January 10, 1947, at the Symposium on Large-Scale Digital Calculating Machinery at the Harvard computation Laboratory, Professor Samuel H. Caldwell of Massachusetts Institute of Technology spoke of the need for an association of those interested in computing machinery, and of the need for communication between them.\n[...]\nAfter making some inquiries during May and June, we believe there is ample interest to start an informal association of many of those interested in the new machinery for computing and reasoning. Since there has to be a beginning, we are acting as a temporary committee to start such an association:\n\nE. C. Berkeley, Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Newark, N. J.\nR. V. D. Campbell, Raytheon Manufacturing Co., Waltham, Mass.\n, Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C.\nH. E. Goheen, Office of Naval Research, Boston, Mass.\nJ. W. Mauchly, Electronic Control Co., Philadelphia, Pa.\nT. K. Sharpless, Moore School of Elec. Eng., Philadelphia, Pa.\nR. Taylor, Mass. Inst. of Tech., Cambridge, Mass.\nC. B. Tompkins, Engineering Research Associates, Washington, D.C. \n\nThe committee (except for Curtiss) had gained experience with computers during World War II: Berkeley, Campbell, and Goheen helped build Harvard Mark I under Howard H. Aiken, Mauchly and Sharpless were involved in building ENIAC, Tompkins had used \"the secret Navy code-breaking machines\", and Taylor had worked on Bush's Differential analyzers.\n\nThe ACM was then founded in 1947 under the name Eastern Association for Computing Machinery, which was changed the following year to the Association for Computing Machinery. The ACM History Committee since 2016 has published the A.M.Turing Oral History project, the ACM Key Award Winners Video Series, and the India Industry Leaders Video project.\n\nActivities\n\nACM is organized into over 246 local professional chapters and 38 Special Interest Groups (SIGs), through which it conducts most of its activities. Additionally, there are over 833 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\n\nMany of the SIGs, such as SIGGRAPH, SIGDA, SIGPLAN, SIGCSE and SIGCOMM, sponsor regular conferences, which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields. The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.\n\nACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between Garry Kasparov and the IBM Deep Blue computer.\n\nServices\n\nPublications\n\nACM publishes over 50 journals including the prestigious Journal of the ACM, and two general magazines for computer professionals, Communications of the ACM (also known as Communications or CACM) and Queue. Other publications of the ACM include:\nACM XRDS, formerly \"Crossroads\", was redesigned in 2010 and is the most popular student computing magazine in the US.\nACM Interactions, an interdisciplinary HCI publication focused on the connections between experiences, people and technology, and the third largest ACM publication.\nACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)\nComputers in Entertainment (CIE)\nACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems (JETC) \nACM Special Interest Group: Computers and Society (SIGCAS)\nA number of journals, specific to subfields of computer science, titled ACM Transactions. Some of the more notable transactions include:\nACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG)\nACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS)\nACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS)\nIEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB)\nACM Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL)\nACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI)\nACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS)\nACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)\nACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)\nACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM)\nIEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON)\nACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS)\n\nAlthough Communications no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages.\n\nACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid subscribers online at its Digital Library and also has a Guide to Computing Literature. ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members.\n\nIn 1997, ACM Press published Wizards and Their Wonders: Portraits in Computing (), written by Christopher Morgan, with new photographs by Louis Fabian Bachrach. The book is a collection of historic and current portrait photographs of figures from the computer industry.\n\nPortal and Digital Library\nThe ACM Portal is an online service of the ACM. Its core are two main sections: ACM Digital Library and the ACM Guide to Computing Literature.\n\nThe ACM Digital Library was launched in October 1997. It is the full-text collection of all articles published by the ACM in its articles, magazines and conference proceedings. The Guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries.\nThe ACM Digital Library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organization's journals, magazines, newsletters and conference proceedings. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest. There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature. This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature.\n\nACM adopted a hybrid Open Access (OA) publishing model in 2013. Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement.\n\nACM was a \"green\" publisher before the term was invented. Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Library's permanently maintained Version of Record.\n\nAll metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world, including abstracts, linked references and citing works, citation and usage statistics, as well as all functionality and services. Other than the free articles, the full-texts are accessed by subscription.\n\nThere is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the open access movement. Some authors see a subscription business model as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like arXiv. Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Journal of Machine Learning Research and the Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology.\n\nACM has made its publications from 1951 to 2000  open access through its digital library on 7 April 2022 as part of its 75th anniversary of the organisation.\n\nMembership grades\n\nIn addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and \"demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers\".\n\nThe number of Fellows, Distinguished Members, and Senior Members cannot exceed 1%, 10%, and 25% of the total number of professional members, respectively.\n\nFellows\n\nThe ACM Fellows Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 \"to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM.\" There are 1,310 Fellows  out of about 100,000 members.\n\nDistinguished Members\nIn 2006, ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades, one which was called Distinguished Members. Distinguished Members (Distinguished Engineers, Distinguished Scientists, and Distinguished Educators) have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership and \"have made a significant impact on the computing field\". In 2006 when the Distinguished Members first came out, one of the three levels was called \"Distinguished Member\" and was changed about two years later to \"Distinguished Educator\". Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles.\n\nList of Distinguished Members of the Association for Computing Machinery\n\nSenior Members\nAlso in 2006, ACM began recognizing Senior Members. According to the ACM, \"The Senior Members Grade recognizes those ACM members with at least 10 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous Professional Membership who have demonstrated performance through technical leadership, and technical or professional contributions\". Senior membership also requires 3 letters of reference\n\nDistinguished Speakers\nWhile not technically a membership grade, the ACM recognizes distinguished speakers on topics in computer science. A distinguished speaker is appointed for a three-year period. There are usually about 125 current distinguished speakers. The ACM website describes these people as 'Renowned International Thought Leaders'. The distinguished speakers program (DSP) has been in existence for over 20 years and serves as an outreach program that brings renowned experts from Academia, Industry and Government to present on the topic of their expertise.  The DSP is overseen by a committee\n\nChapters\nACM has three kinds of chapters: Special Interest Groups, Professional Chapters, and Student Chapters.\n\n, ACM has professional & SIG Chapters in 56 countries.\n\n, there exist ACM student chapters in 41 countries.\n\nSpecial Interest Groups\n\n SIGACCESS: Accessible Computing\n SIGACT: Algorithms and Computation Theory\n SIGAda: Ada Programming Language\n SIGAI: Artificial Intelligence\n SIGAPP: Applied Computing\n SIGARCH: Computer Architecture\n SIGBED: Embedded Systems\n SIGBio: Bioinformatics \n SIGCAS: Computers and Society\n SIGCHI: Computer–Human Interaction\n SIGCOMM: Data Communication\n SIGCSE: Computer Science Education\n SIGDA: Design Automation\n SIGDOC: Design of Communication\n SIGecom: Electronic Commerce\n SIGEVO: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation\n SIGGRAPH: Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques\n SIGHPC: High Performance Computing\n SIGIR: Information Retrieval\n SIGITE: Information Technology Education\n SIGKDD: Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining\n SIGLOG: Logic and Computation\n SIGMETRICS: Measurement and Evaluation\n SIGMICRO: Microarchitecture\n SIGMIS: Management Information Systems\n SIGMM: Multimedia\n SIGMOBILE: Mobility of Systems, Users, Data and Computing\n SIGMOD: Management of Data\n SIGOPS: Operating Systems\n SIGPLAN: Programming Languages\n SIGSAC: Security, Audit, and Control\n SIGSAM: Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation\n SIGSIM: Simulation and Modeling\n SIGSOFT: Software Engineering\n SIGSPATIAL: Spatial Information\n SIGUCCS: University and College Computing Services\n SIGWEB: Hypertext, Hypermedia, and Web\n\nConferences\n\nACM and its Special Interest Groups (SIGs) sponsors numerous conferences with 170 hosted worldwide in 2017. ACM Conferences page has an up-to-date complete list while a partial list is shown below. Most of the SIGs also have an annual conference. ACM conferences are often very popular publishing venues and are therefore very competitive. For example, SIGGRAPH 2007 attracted about 30000 attendees, while CIKM 2005 and RecSys 2022 had paper acceptance rates of only accepted 15% and 17% respectively.\n\n AIES: Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society\n ASPLOS: International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems\n CHI: Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems\n CIKM: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management\n COMPASS: International Conference on Computing and Sustainable Societies\n DAC: Design Automation Conference\n DEBS: Distributed Event Based Systems\n FAccT: Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency\n FCRC: Federated Computing Research Conference\n GECCO: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference\n HT: Hypertext: Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia\n JCDL: Joint Conference on Digital Libraries\n MobiHoc: International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing\n SC: Supercomputing Conference\n SIGCOMM: ACM SIGCOMM Conference\n SIGCSE: SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education\n SIGGRAPH: International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques\n RecSys: ACM Conference on Recommender Systems\n TAPIA: Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference \n\nThe ACM is a co–presenter and founding partner of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) with the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology.\n\nSome conferences are hosted by ACM student branches; this includes Reflections Projections, which is hosted by UIUC ACM. In addition, ACM sponsors regional conferences. Regional conferences facilitate increased opportunities for collaboration between nearby institutions and they are well attended.\n\nFor additional non-ACM conferences, see this list of computer science conferences.\n\nAwards\nThe ACM presents or co–presents a number of awards for outstanding technical and professional achievements and contributions in computer science and information technology. \n\n ACM A.

Berenbaum Distinguished Service Award\n ACM Maurice Wilkes Award\n ISCA Influential Paper Award\n\nLeadership\n\nThe President of ACM for 2022–2024 is Yannis Ioannidis, Professor at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He is successor of Gabriele Kotsis (2020–2022), Professor at the Johannes Kepler University Linz; Cherri M. Pancake (2018–2020), Professor Emeritus at Oregon State University and Director of the Northwest Alliance for Computational Science and Engineering (NACSE); Vicki L. Hanson (2016–2018), Distinguished Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology and visiting professor at the University of Dundee; Alexander L. Wolf (2014–2016), Dean of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Vint Cerf (2012–2014), American computer scientist and Internet pioneer; Alain Chesnais (2010–2012); and Dame Wendy Hall of the University of Southampton, UK (2008–2010).\n\nACM is led by a council consisting of the president, vice-president, treasurer, past president, SIG Governing Board Chair, Publications Board Chair, three representatives of the SIG Governing Board, and seven Members-At-Large. This institution is often referred to simply as \"Council\" in Communications of the ACM.\n\nInfrastructure\nACM has numerous boards, committees, and task forces which run the organization:\n\n ACM Council\n ACM Executive Committee\n Digital Library Board\n Education Board\n Practitioner Board\n Publications Board\n SIG Governing Board\n DEI Council\n ACM Technology Policy Council\n ACM Representatives to Other Organizations\n Computer Science Teachers Association\n\nACM Council on Women in Computing\n\nACM-W, the ACM council on women in computing, supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in computing. ACM–W's main programs are regional celebrations of women in computing, ACM-W chapters, and scholarships for women CS students to attend research conferences. In India and Europe these activities are overseen by ACM-W India and ACM-W Europe respectively.  ACM-W collaborates with organizations such as the Anita Borg Institute, the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), and Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W).\nThe ACM-W gives an annual Athena Lecturer Award to honor outstanding women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science. This program began in 2006. Speakers are nominated by SIG officers.\n\nPartner organizations\nACM's primary partner has been the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS), which is the largest subgroup of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical computer science, but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda. They have many joint activities including conferences, publications and awards. ACM and its SIGs co-sponsor about 20 conferences each year with IEEE-CS and other parts of IEEE. Eckert-Mauchly Award and Ken Kennedy Award, both major awards in computer science, are given jointly by ACM and the IEEE-CS. They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula.\n\nACM has also jointly sponsored on events with other professional organizations like the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).\n\nCriticism\n\nIn December 2019, the ACM co-signed a letter with over one hundred other publishers to President Donald Trump saying that an open access mandate would increase costs to taxpayers or researchers and hurt intellectual property. This was in response to rumors that he was considering issuing an executive order that would require federally funded research be made freely available online immediately after being published. It is unclear how these rumors started. Many ACM members opposed the letter, leading ACM to issue a statement clarifying that they remained committed to open access, and they wanted to see communication with stakeholders about the potential mandate. The statement did not significantly assuage criticism from ACM members.\n\nThe SoCG conference, while originally an ACM conference, parted ways with ACM in 2014 because of problems when organizing conferences abroad.\n\nSee also\n\n ACM Classification Scheme\n Franz Alt, former president\n\n Edmund Berkeley, co-founder\n Computer science\n Computing\n Bernard Galler, former president\n Fellows of the ACM (by year)\n Fellows of the ACM (category)\n Grace Murray Hopper Award\n\n Presidents of the Association for Computing Machinery\n Timeline of computing hardware before 1950\n Turing Award\n List of academic databases and search engines\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nACM portal for publications\nACM Digital Library\nAssociation for Computing Machinery Records, 1947-2009, Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota.\n ACM Upsilon Phi Epsilon  honor society\n\n \n1947 establishments in the United States\nComputer science-related professional associations\nInternational learned societies\nOrganizations established in 1947\n501(c)(3) organizations"
