      "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the formation of the American pop rock band Fun, specifically mentioning the former lead singer of The Format who also started performing as a solo musician in a certain year.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to look through the provided contexts to find relevant information. The key here is to identify the former lead singer of The Format and the year they started performing solo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the context entries, there's a mention of \"Nate Ruess\" in the context related to the band Fun. The context says: \"Nate Ruess (born February 26, 1982) is an American singer and songwriter. He is the lead singer of the indie pop band Fun., and previously of The Format. As of 2015, he also performs as a solo musician.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "So, Nate Ruess was the former lead singer of The Format. The question mentions he started performing as a solo musician in a certain year. The context states \"As of 2015, he also performs as a solo musician.\" However, the exact year he started his solo career isn't explicitly mentioned here. But looking further, there's another context entry about the band Fun: \"Fun (stylized as fun.) is an American pop rock band based in New York City. The band was formed by Nate Ruess (former lead singer of The Format), with Andrew Dost (of Anathallo), and Jack Antonoff (of Steel Train and Bleachers).\" This confirms that Nate Ruess was the former lead singer of The Format. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the question is about the year he started performing as a solo musician. The context says \"As of 2015, he also performs as a solo musician.\" However, the exact year he started isn't given here. But looking at the other context entries, there's a mention of Andrew Heermans and his band FUN, but that's not relevant. The key is Nate Ruess. The answer should be 2015, as that's when he started performing as a solo musician according to the context. Wait, but the context says \"As of 2015,\" which might mean he started earlier. However, the exact year isn't specified in the context. Wait, the context says \"As of 2015, he also performs as a solo musician.\" But the question is asking for the year he started. The context might not specify the exact year, but the answer is 2015. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 2008 when he formed Fun, but that's not the solo career. Wait, the context says he was part of The Format before forming Fun. The question is about when he started performing as a solo musician. The context says \"As of 2015, he also performs as a solo musician.\" But that doesn't specify when he started. However, looking at the other context entries, there's a mention of \"He started performing with bands on a regular basis upon a family move to Boulder, Colorado in 1969.\" But that's Andrew Heermans, not Nate Ruess. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the context about Nate Ruess says: \"As of 2015, he also performs as a solo musician.\" But the question is asking for the year he started. The context doesn't specify the exact year he started, but the answer might be 2015. However, the user's question is phrased as \"started performing as a solo musician in this year?\" So the answer is 2015. But the context says \"As of 2015,\" which might mean that he started in 2015. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 2008 when he formed Fun, but that's not solo. The answer is 2015. So the answer is 2015. But the context says \"As of 2015,\" so the answer is 2015.\n",

But the user might have the answer as \"α-PVP\" since that's the common name. However, the question is about the stimulant's name, so the full name. But the user's instruction says to use only a span from the context. The exact phrase is \"α-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone (also known as α-PVP) is a synthetic stimulant...\" So the answer is α-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone.
